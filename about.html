            <p>This Afro House remix of Mayra's "Afeto" is currently what gets me going! A mix of African beats and Portuguese, perfect for studying or dancing. <br>If you're interested in the song, please check out Mayra Andrade (the singer) and Ankhoï (the remixer). <br><strong>* This version is cropped and I do not own this song.</strong></p>

            <p>
                I've always been fascinated by how the world works and how we can influence it for the better. Growing up in São Paulo, I experienced firsthand the stark contrasts in society—from the bustling, advanced parts of the city to the underprivileged areas that struggle to access basic resources. This exposure inspired my passion for social entrepreneurship, leading to my involvement with the Ubuntu Project, where I help connect students with NGOs and empower communities like Jardim Panorama.
            </p>
            <p>
                Academically, I've always leaned toward problem-solving, whether through coding, engineering challenges, or creative endeavors like AI-driven projects. My interest in technology was further deepened by the opportunity to design an AI game during my school’s AI Week. Through intense periods of programming and debugging, I learned to balance creativity with technical problem-solving, which not only expanded my skill set but also highlighted the importance of pushing personal boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                At my core, I'm driven by a desire to use technology and education as tools for positive change. Whether it’s through volunteering, my extracurricular projects, or academic achievements, I’m always looking for ways to bridge gaps, challenge assumptions, and create solutions that benefit the world around me.
